# Task - 3 (BMI Calculator)

Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and category to the user.

# Key Concepts and Challenges:

1. User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
2. BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
3. Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
4. GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays.
